            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Lakshmi Harathi Alavala </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Jaladanki, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am a MERN Stack Developer with a strong passion for building dynamic and responsive web applications.
            <br />
            I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Anantapur, with an SGPA of 8.0.
            <br />
            During my frontend internship at DevSkillHub, I gained hands-on experience in React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, developing responsive web applications and optimizing website performance. I also worked on an e-commerce project that included features like product listing, search, and cart management.
            <br />
            Apart from web development, I have also worked on an IoT-based project, Smart Gloves for Deaf and Dumb People, which helps bridge communication gaps using embedded sensors and a connected application.
